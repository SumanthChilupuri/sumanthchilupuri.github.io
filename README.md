My professional journey began at Infosys, where I immersed myself in the world of data analytics. What started as a role analyzing databases and engineering SQL queries soon evolved into a passion for optimizing performance and ensuring data integrity.

I took pride in developing robust data connections between Tableau and various sources, paving the way for seamless data integration and access. This experience fueled my desire to establish best practices, document coding standards, and create comprehensive reference manuals â€“ efforts that boosted team productivity by 25%.

Within a year, my exceptional grasp of core concepts, technical mastery, and effective communication led me to achieve the coveted "Subject Matter Expert" status for the "Appeals" module. This accomplishment showcased my rapid professional growth and ability to collaborate cross-functionally, co-creating comprehensive Business Requirements Documentation (BRDs) with business analysts.

Alongside these achievements, I also demonstrated my problem-solving prowess by securing a Top 500 rank nationwide at HackWithInfy, Infosys' esteemed algorithm-focused hackathon. This experience solidified my passion for data analytics and motivated me to pursue a Master's degree, where I could further hone my skills and explore new frontiers in the field.
